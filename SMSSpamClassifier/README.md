# Simple SMS Spam Classifier

The objective of the project is to construct a classifier that allows to predict if a new SMS message is SPAM or if it is a normal (HAM) message.

We'll be using the SMSSpamCollection dataset from UCI dataset that contains 5000 SMS phone messages labeled Ham or SPAM.

After Inspecting and cleaning the dataset, we'll create two types of models:
1.  A model based on the punctuantions and length of the message. 
2.  A model that extract features from the texts messages.
